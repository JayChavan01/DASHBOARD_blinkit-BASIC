# DASHBOARD_blinkit BASIC
### Overview:
This project analyzes data related to basic IT operations, focusing on key metrics like system performance, user activity, and troubleshooting activities. The analysis is conducted using SQL for data processing, Excel for initial exploration, and Power BI for creating dynamic, interactive visualizations that provide actionable insights for IT teams and decision-makers.

### Key Features:
1. Data Processing (SQL):
   - Extracted relevant data from IT databases using SQL queries.
   - Cleaned and aggregated data for easier analysis.
   - Created specific SQL queries to track system performance, user activity, and issues reported.

2. Data Exploration and Summarization (Excel):
   - Utilized Excel for initial exploratory analysis and simple aggregations.
   - Created pivot tables to group and summarize system performance data.
   - Used Excel charts to quickly visualize key trends and patterns.

3. Interactive Dashboard (Power BI):
   - Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates all relevant metrics.  
   - Key visualizations include:
     - System Performance Tracking: Visualized uptime, downtime, and performance degradation.
     - User Activity Analysis: Analyzed user logins, actions, and behavior patterns.
     - Troubleshooting Insights: Highlighted the most frequent issues reported and their resolutions.
   - Incorporated slicers and filters for users to drill down into specific time periods, systems, or user activities.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- SQL:  
  - Processed and extracted raw IT operation data.  
  - Ran queries to identify patterns in system performance and user behavior.

- Microsoft Excel:
  - Conducted preliminary analysis, data validation, and basic charting.  
  - Summarized key trends in the data.

- Power BI:
  - Built an interactive dashboard to showcase insights.  
  - Combined SQL and Excel data to create real-time visualizations and drill-down capabilities.
